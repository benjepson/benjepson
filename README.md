- 👋 Hi, I’m @benjepson, and I'm using the suggested template!
- 👀 I’m interested in graphs, statistics and science.
- I'm an industrial statistician with a background in food science
- I'm especially interested in helping regular people make great graphs, design of experiments, statistical process control
- I'm extra interested in ways to make sense of data, that work for normal people!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github, and powering up my R skills
- I'm going to learn to create an R package and send it out into the world
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on R packages, and things pertaining to my interests
