- 👀 I’m interested in statistics and science.

- I'm especially interested in design of experiments, statistical process control
- I'm extra interested in ways to make sense of data, that work for normal people!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github, and powering up my R skills
- I'm going to learn to create an R package and send it out into the world
- Also improving my presentation skills - github pages, interactive vis, youtube
